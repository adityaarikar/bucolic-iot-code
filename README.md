#  Single_Core_IoT for Only Supporting Mushroom Garden System 1 

- D1 ESP Pin to Realy for Controlling Pump A
- D2 ESP Pin to Realy for Controlling Pump B


- D7 ESP Pin is SPI Pin Connected to DHT11 SENSOR DATA PIN


- TURN OFF D3 PIN when Switching on Pump_A(D1 pin) or PUMP_B(D2 PIN)
- Again, TURN ON D3 PIN after All triggering is complete on D1 and D2 pins. 

## = For 12V, 10 Amp SMPS
  - Light and Fan Connections Are Directly to SPMS for all time On.

## = For 12V, 5 Amp SPMPS
  - Light and Fan Connections Are Directly to one single Realy connected to D3 ESP Pin
  - TURN OFF D3 PIN when Switching on Pump_A(D1 pin) or PUMP_B(D2 PIN)
  - Again, TURN ON D3 PIN after All triggering is complete on D1 and D2 pins.
